# This is a mini project for  small chat box in a firm (06-06-2021)
# It consists of the server-side and the client side
# the server side  script will be run on the command line whiles the client script will be executed 
# with ip address, clients or workers can connect to the server through a local network

#---------------this scrit is the server script to be run on window cmd or terminal on linux-------------------------
